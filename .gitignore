# Actually, for Capacitor, often people commit the android folder if they make native changes.
# But for a pure wrapper, we can generate it. 
# HOWEVER, to be safe and let the user have a "full" project, we will NOT ignore android folder by default 
# so they can commit the generated scaffold.
# Let's just ignore the build artifacts.
